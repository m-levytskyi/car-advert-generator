# Architecture

This chapter describes the architecture of the system.

## Overview

[Give an overview of the architecture]

## Modules 

[Describe the modules of your system. If you added/removed/changed modules, explain why and change the chapter structure accordingly. A module description contains: Role in the overall system, input/output data, data flow, used packages, specific design decisions, ...]

### Webcam 

### Object Detector 

[Also describe the used architectures (see team-project presentation) in short (most important advances)]


::: {.callout-tip}
You can reference literature from bibtex files (references.bib). Example: Use @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.

### Article Agent 

[Also describe the used tools (e.g. wikipedia) and the reason for that choice]

### Article Assembler 

[Also describe potential article templates/structures you designed]

### Diffusion Model 

[Also describe the used diffusion model]

You can also work with equations. Example:
 (@eq-black-scholes) is a mathematical model that seeks to explain the behavior of financial derivatives, most commonly options:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathrm C}{ \partial \mathrm t } + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} \mathrm S^{2}
\frac{\partial^{2} \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm C^2}
  + \mathrm r \mathrm S \frac{\partial \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm S}\ =
  \mathrm r \mathrm C 
$$ {#eq-black-scholes}
