## Article Structure

The generated article follows a consistent structure designed for automotive advertisements:

1. **Header**: Car brand and model title with "Future of Driving" tagline
2. **Introduction**: Opening section with initial vehicle overview
3. **New Model Overview**: Design aesthetics and key model highlights
4. **Brand Heritage**: Company legacy and historical achievements
5. **Innovative Featurest**: Advanced technology and unique selling points

The layout alternates between text content and supporting images, with figures placed left and right for visual balance. Each image includes a descriptive caption.

The article uses a dark theme with contrasting elements and concludes with a call-to-action button for test drive bookings.
